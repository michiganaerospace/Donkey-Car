# Donkey-Car
The Donkey Car is a remote/self driving RC car project which runs on a Raspberry Pi. We have created some documentation (Donkey RC Car Setup.docx) on how to assemble the Donkey Car that needs to be completed. In this github there is a group of solidworks/stl files that can be used to 3d print parts required to make the Donkey Car. The donkey car docs file has a link to a website with extensive documentation on the Donkey Car. There is a large ammount of additional info at http://docs.donkeycar.com/ , so check it out.
