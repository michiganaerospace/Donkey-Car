# Donkey-Car
The Donkey Car is a remote/self driving RC car project which runs on a Raspberry Pi. We have created some documentation on how to assemble the donkey car that needs to be completed. In this github there is a group of solidworks/stl files that can be used to 3d print parts required to make the donkey car.
